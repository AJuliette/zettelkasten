## 202008181955 Hypercard

 ```
 HyperCard was an application built for the Mac operating system in the late 80s. 
 It allowed its users to create stacks of virtual “cards,” each with a bit of info. Users could then connect these cards however they wanted, 
 and quickly sort, search, and navigate through their stacks. People used it to organize their recipes, replace their Rolodexes, 
 organize research notes, and a million other things.
