#design #responsive

You don't know how your page is gonna be read: on which screens, with which connection. You should not put effort in imagining 
designs for fixes screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using media querry to define pages for each breakpoint. You cannot 
think in pixels with fixed values. You will always have points where your content "breaks", the **seams**.

```
designing from the canvas in: defining the boundaries of your page, designing a grid on that canvas, 
and then filling that grid with stuff. 
designing from the content out can create more interconnected, more harmonious layouts.
