Using the Line Mode Browser today, you would probably feel like a hacker from the 1980s. 
It was a text-only browser designed to run from a command line terminal. In most cases, just plain white text on a black background, 
pixels bleeding from edge to edge. Typing out a web address into the browser would bring up that websiteâ€™s text on the screen. 
The up and down arrows on a keyboard could be used for navigation. Links were visible as a numbered list, and one could jump from site to site by 
entering the right number.
