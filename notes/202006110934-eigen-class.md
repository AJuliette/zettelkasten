## 202006110934 The Eigenclass

It is called the Singleton class. When you create an instance of the class, it creates a copy of the original class owned only 
by this instance. If you modify the Eigenclass of your first instance it won't change the other instances.

=> Only Eigenclasses of its instances are singletons.

```ruby
class ExampleObject
  def printHello
    puts 'Hello'
  end
end

object1 = ExampleObject.new
object2 = ExampleObject.new

class << object2
  def printHello
    puts 'Aloha'
  end
end

object1.printHello # => 'Hello'
object2.printHello # => 'Aloha'
```
