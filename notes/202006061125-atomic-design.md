### 202006061125 Atomic design

#notetaking #organization #design

In the Zettelkasten design each note should be "atomic" and therefore "autonomous" (they can be moved around to create new links
/ connections). That made me thing of:
- `git` commits where you should get the smallest commit possible: one change by commit for a better reading and possibility of reverse.
- websites that came from Craiglist sections. The websites are getting more and more specialized.<br/>

Your website should do one thing and do it well.
